## Embedding Logo in HTML Reports

The audit log HTML report now includes a logo at the top, embedded as a base64 PNG image. To update the logo:

1. Replace the base64 string in `python/logo_base64.txt` with your own PNG logo (base64-encoded).
2. The logo will appear automatically in all generated audit log HTML reports.

You can use an online tool to convert your PNG image to base64, then paste the string into `python/logo_base64.txt`.
